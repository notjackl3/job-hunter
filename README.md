# job-hunter ðŸ”Ž
This Django web app helps you search for jobs within the tech industry. It will help you find, manage and filter out the most updated jobs on platforms including `LinkedIn`, `Indeed`, and `Google`. Additionally, it writes cover letter in a blink of an eye. Lastly, statistics about job demands will be shown.

*(I spent a lot of time scrolling through countless platforms to search for jobs. Thus, I wanted to create an app which scrapes the internet and returns the latest job posts. Along the way, I figured that having information about the most popular techlogies will be useful, and also the ability to write cover letter).*

## Features

- User authentication and password reset via email.
- Scrape job opportunities based on keywords, location, and upload dates.
- Allow job posts management and filtering.
- Write tailored cover letters.
- Display job market information (posting dates, most common languages, technologies, keywords).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, AWS EC2.

This app is built using Django for the backend, with `supabase` as the primary database. On the other hand, the frontend is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and hosted on AWS EC2.

The user authentication system is managed using Djangoâ€™s built-in `authentication system` and `regex`. Additional tools like `jobspy2` handle web scraping tasks across platforms. Moreover, it integrates the `openai` api to generate personalized cover letters based on job descriptions and resume. Besides, the `nltk` module is used for keyword extractions and analysis, while `matplotlib` and `chart.js` allow graphical visualisations.

## What I Learned Through This Project:

- Django authentication system.
- Web scraping techniques.
- Collect data and build up real-time charts.
- Deploy app using AWS EC2.
- REST api structure, communications between front-end and back-end.
